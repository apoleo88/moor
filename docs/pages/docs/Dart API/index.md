After writing a database [as described in the setup page]({{ '../setup.md' | pageUrl }}),
drift will generate code enabling you to write SQL statements in Dart.

The pages on [select statements]({{ 'select.md' | pageUrl }}) and [insert, updates and deletes]({{ 'writes.md' | pageUrl }})
explain how to construct statements.

Advanced features include support for transactions, complex SQL expressions and [database accessor classes]({{ 'daos.md' | pageUrl }}).
